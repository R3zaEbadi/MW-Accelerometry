Milky Way Accelerometry via Millisecond Pulsar Timing

The temporal stability of millisecond pulsars is remarkable, rivaling even some terrestrial atomicclocks at long timescales. Using this property, we show that millisecond pulsars distributed in thegalactic neighborhood form an ensemble of accelerometers from which we can directly extract thelocal galactic acceleration.  From pulsar spin period measurements, we demonstrate accelerationsensitivity with about 1Ïƒprecision using 117 pulsars. We also present a complementary analysisusing orbital periods of 13 binary pulsar systems that eliminates systematics associated with pulsarbraking and results in a local acceleration of<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\left(1.7\pm0.5\right)\times{10}^{-10}\mathrm{&space;m/s}^2" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\left(1.7\pm0.5\right)\times{10}^{-10}\mathrm{&space;m/s}^2" title="\left(1.7\pm0.5\right)\times{10}^{-10}\mathrm{ m/s}^2" /></a>.  This work is a first steptoward dynamically measuring acceleration gradients that will eventually inform us about the darkmatter density distribution in the Milky Way galaxy.
